    <section class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The HDB Renovation AI Assistant is part of the Interior Design Chatbot Suite.
        It provides fast, accurate, and regulation-compliant renovation guidance
        for HDB homeowners in Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        By leveraging Generative AI, the chatbot reduces confusion, delays,
        and uncertainty during renovation planning, allowing users to make
        informed decisions before engaging an interior designer.

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section class="card muted">
      <h2>Problem Addressed</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional interior design consultations are time-consuming and often
        require physical meetings. Many HDB homeowners are unsure about renovation
        rules, realistic budgets, renovation timelines, and suitable design concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This results in delays, miscommunication, and poor renovation decisions.
        The HDB Renovation AI Assistant addresses these challenges by providing
        instant, property-specific guidance.

    <!-- AI Explanation -->
    <section class="card muted">
      <h2>AI & Technology Used</h2>
      <p>
        This chatbot is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated using
        a chatbot flow platform. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied
        to ground responses in HDB renovation guidelines, space planning principles,
        and realistic cost ranges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AI is designed to support users ethically by providing transparent,
        fact-based information and does not replace certified interior designers.
